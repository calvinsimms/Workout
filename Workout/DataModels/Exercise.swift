    // MARK: - Why Hashable is Needed
       /*
        Hashable allows Exercise objects to be stored in collections that require uniqueness or fast lookup,
        such as Sets or as keys in Dictionaries. Without Hashable, you couldn't do things like:
        
        1. Store a set of exercises to ensure no duplicates:
           var exerciseSet: Set<Exercise> = []
           exerciseSet.insert(Exercise(name: "Squat"))
        
        2. Use Exercise as a key in a Dictionary:
           var exerciseData: [Exercise: Int] = [:]
           exerciseData[Exercise(name: "Push-up")] = 10
        
        3. SwiftUI's ForEach can also benefit from Hashable when using dynamic data structures.
        
        By making the hash based on the unique `id`, we ensure that each Exercise is uniquely identifiable
        even if two exercises have the same name.
